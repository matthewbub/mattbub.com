Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, took the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro) for a test drive, offering a unique perspective on the recently reemerged competitive landscape of virtual reality headsets.

Zuckerberg's confidence in the [Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3) shines through, especially when highlighting its prowess in gaming, social interactions, and physical activities. This confidence is backed by Meta's continued [investment of $36 billion into the metaverse](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-lost-30-billion-on-metaverse-rivals-spent-far-less-2022-10), aiming to create a versatile and immersive experience for users.

In his analysis, Zuckerberg pointed out several key differences between the two headsets:

- The Quest 3 is lighter - by approximately 120 grams. A noticeable difference in terms of comfortability and extended use.
- The Vision Pro has a higher screen resolution - Zuckerberg maintained fairness, acknowledging the Vision Pro's screen resolution is sharper and therefore provides a more detailed visual experience.
- The Quest 3 is Cordless - Where as the Vision Pro's requires the power bank to operate.
- The Quest 3 provides a better experience for extended sessions - The Vision Pro lacks traditional controls, relying entirely on eye tracking and hand gestures for navigation and interaction. This contrasts sharply with the Quest 3, which includes controllers with each purchase, providing a familiar and intuitive interface for users.
- Open Model and Third-Party Support: Zuckerberg also highlighted the Quest 3's open model, which allows for third-party support, such as Logitech. This feature extends the Quest 3's capabilities by enabling the use of additional peripherals like keyboards and mice, further enriching the user experience.

The virtual reality landscape is rapidly evolving, the choices made by companies like Meta and Apple will undoubtedly shape the future of how we interact with digital environments.

This article is all about Railway, a cloud service provider with a generous free tier for rapid prototyping and hobbyist projects. Our goal is to demonstrate how we can create a new PostgreSQL instance, obtain the database credentials and keep it moving.

1. Login or create and account on https://railway.app/
2. Select "New project" or navigate to https://railway.app/new
3. Under the "What can we help with?" menu, select "Provision PostgreSQL"
4. It will take a few minutes to load, once complete select the Postgres card
5. Select the Variables tab - The keys provided can be used to connect to your new PostgreSQL instance!

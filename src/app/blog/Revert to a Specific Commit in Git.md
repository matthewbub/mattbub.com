To revert a commit in Git using the commit ID in a clean branch, follow these steps. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Git and terminal commands.

## Pre-requisites:

- Ensure you have Git installed on your system.
- Basic familiarity with using the command line or terminal.

## Steps to Revert a Commit:

### 1. Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.

Navigate to your project directory where you wish to revert a commit.

### 2. Check the Commit History.

To identify the commit you want to revert. Use the command:

```shell
git log --oneline
```

This will display a list of recent commits with their IDs and messages. Note the commit ID of the commit you want to revert.

### 3. Switch to a Clean Branch (Optional).

If you're not already on a clean branch, it's a good practice to switch to one to avoid any conflicts. Create and switch to a new branch by using:

```shell
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

### 4. Revert the Commit.

To revert the specific commit, use the command:

```shell
git revert <commit-id>
```

Replace `<commit-id>` with the actual ID of the commit you found earlier. Git will create a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit.

### 5. Handle Any Merge Conflicts.

If Git indicates any merge conflicts, resolve them by editing the conflicted files, then add and commit those changes.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts while reverting"
```

### 6. Push the Changes (If Necessary)

If you're working on a shared repository (e.g. GitHub), push the changes to the remote repository:

```shell
git push origin <new-branch-name>
```

### 7. Verify the Reversion.

Finally, verify that the commit has been successfully reverted by checking the commit history again:

```shell
git log --oneline
```

## Wrapping Up

These steps outline a safe way of reverting to any commit without affecting the integrity of your project.

Remember, reverting creates a new commit that undoes the changes, so it's a safe operation that doesn't alter the project's history.

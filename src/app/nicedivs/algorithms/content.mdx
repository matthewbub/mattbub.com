## Merge Sort Notes

- The idea is to sort small arrays and merge the results into a big array using recursion

- its fast at the expense of memory

## Bubble Sort Notes

- Move the higher valued elements to the right and the lower valued elements generally to the left

Pseudo

```
- Start with a swap counter set to some non-zero number
- Keep looping (recursion) until we make zero swaps (that's when we know it's sorted)
  - Reset the swap counter to 0 for this pass
  - Go through each pair of adjacent elements in the array
    - If they're out of order, swap them and bump the counter by 1
```

- this builds the array from the largest to smallest because of the way we work from the start to end

- I think this will sort the array one index at a time until completion
- There's a point in which all the array is fully sorted, but the bubble sort is not aware of this until it runs the final pass

- Worst case: You're stuck with a completely backwards array. Each element has to bubble all the way across, and since you can only get one element sorted per pass, you end up doing this `n` times.
- Best case: The array's already sorted and you make zero swaps on the first pass.

My questions

- Are Sorting algo's all achieving the same thing at different speeds? is this just a cicle jerk of time complexity
  - A: AI says no, but pretty much thats what it is lmao

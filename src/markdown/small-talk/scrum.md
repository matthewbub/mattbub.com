## Scrum artifacts.

Scrum artifacts focus on three artifacts specific to Scrum: the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Increment.

**A Product Backlog** is a comprehensive list of everything required for the product, guided by the **Product Goal**, which helps measure progress.

**The Sprint Backlog** is a collection of work the team commits to complete during a sprint, with the **Sprint Goal** directing their focus.

**Increments** are the sum of completed items during a sprint that are ready for release, governed by the **Definition of Done**, which ensures quality and clarity on when work is considered complete.

Each of these artifacts have a commitment, that we must abide by.

### product backlog

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of what we need to do to improve the product.

It's intended to serve as the single source of truth for the Scrum team as far as where you go to pick up work.

The first step is going to be to list all requirements based on the current understanding of the product. Usually what happens is that time progresses, new requirements are added and old ones are modified, deleted, or decided that they're no longer needed. This makes the Product Backlog kind of like always evolving and never quite done.

What usually drives changes to a Product Backlog are stakeholders or the business team responding to market feedback and changes in conditions and technology. Based on this input, new features or fixes are identified to the existing product. The Product Owner then integrates these changes into the Product Backlog.

So this whole phase is more for the Product Owner as far as Backlog Refinement. But the developers and other members of the Scrum team also contribute by defining these requirements into smaller, more precise items.

### sprint backlog

Alright, another Scrum artifact is the Sprint Backlog, which is composed of the Sprint Goal. There's usually a set of Product Backlog items that have been chosen for a given Sprint, and whatever gets chosen for that Sprint is what's decided will be done. The Sprint Backlog is considered a plan by and for the developers. It's intended to be highly visible, providing a real-time picture of the work that the developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint to achieve their Sprint Goal.

The Sprint Backlog is determined during the Sprint Planning event, where the team sits down and selects items from the Product Backlog that can compete in the Sprint to contribute toward the Sprint Goal. We monitor the Sprint Backlog each day in the Daily Scrum, where developers report their progress and any impediments they may face. The intention of this meeting is to keep the team aligned and up to date with the Sprint Backlog according to the evolving understanding, because things are always changing.

Ownership of the Sprint Backlog is with the developers. They have the freedom to adjust the plan as necessary to achieve the Sprint Goal, with all progress being as transparent as possible to the entire Scrum Team. Any time a change happens, the entire Scrum Team should know about it. However, any risks to not achieving the Sprint Goal must be promptly communicated to the Product Owner and stakeholders. If something is going to risk the Sprint Goal, then we need to be visible about that immediately and take steps to address or prepare for it.

Keeping the Sprint Backlog visible, with all changes said aloud, is important to keeping the entire Scrum Team and stakeholders in alignment. It helps make decisions.

### increment

An increment is the final releasable output created during a sprint and represents a concrete stepping stone towards achieving the product goal.

The output from the developers should always result in a usable product. We're not limited to one increment during a sprint. You can add more. And you can also release these increments to stakeholders before the sprint review. These increments are presented at sprint review, which is intended to provide a real-time picture of the progress towards the goal. This all ties to the definition of done, which, as we recall, is crucial in determining when an increment is considered complete.

It's the formal description of the state of the increment when it meets the quality standard required for the product. So if a product backlog item meets the definition of done, it becomes part of an increment. If a product backlog item does not meet the definition of done, it is not included in the increment and returns to the product backlog for future consideration.

It becomes pretty essential to have a definition of done when you are working with multiple Scrum teams on a single product. It helps ensure that all teams adhere to the same quality standards, maintaining a uniform level of quality across the product's development.

## Advantages and disadvantages of Scrum

Advantages of Scrum:

- Transparency and visibility: Daily stand-ups give everyone clarity on who is doing what, helping identify issues early.
- Improved communication and accountability: The team collaborates to decide sprint work and resolves issues collectively, rather than relying on a single project manager.
- Flexibility to accommodate change: Short sprints and continuous feedback make it easier to adapt in fast-moving projects.
- Cost efficiency: Ongoing communication helps the team stay aware of issues and adjust quickly, which can reduce waste.
- Faster delivery: Scrum enables quick, efficient delivery of increments.
- Strong customer/stakeholder feedback loop: Continuous feedback feeds the product backlog, improving the product iteratively.

Disadvantages of Scrum:

- Requires experience and commitment: Teams unfamiliar with Scrum face a learning curve; poor practice or ad-hoc hybrids reduce benefits.
- Risk of scope creep: Continuous feedback can expand scope, especially without clear goals or end dates, inflating timelines and costs.
- Daily Scrum fatigue: Daily meetings can frustrate team members and hurt commitment if not run effectively.
- Impact of a poor Scrum Master: Ineffective facilitation can stall momentum and harm team morale.
- Poorly defined work: Vague tasks lead to missteps; inaccurate or unclear goals cause longer sprint planning and unreliable timelines and costs.
- Prioritization challenges: Starting without a solid, prioritized backlog makes sprint planning harder and can balloon effort.

## key agile concepts

Alright, a burndown chart is an essential tool in Agile project management. It's used to track progress throughout a sprint or product release. It's basically a chart that visually displays the amount of work completed against the amount of estimated work remaining. The x-axis represents the days elapsed since the project's start, while the y-axis shows the remaining work measured in hours, story points, or tasks.

The chart typically features two key lines: the estimated effort line, which is often shown in red and indicates the ideal progress; and the actual effort line, which is displayed in blue and reflects the team's real performance. I think this is the important part to read again if I get confused.

There are various scenarios that can be depicted by a burndown chart. Some of those scenarios include:

- The ideal scenario: when the actual line aligns with the estimated line, indicating the team is on track.
- Catching up: the team initially progresses slowly but eventually meets the estimated line.
- Late completion: work occurs on time despite a slow start.
- Missed deadline: the project falls behind schedule, requiring adjustments.
- Overestimation: the actual effort line is below the estimated line, showing faster-than-expected progress.
- Inconsistent updates: updates are only made at the end, failing to show real-time progress.

Good to know. Good to know. Good to know. Good to know.

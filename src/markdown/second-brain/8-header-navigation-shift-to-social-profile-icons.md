I updated the site header navigation from text links to branded social icon links for GitHub, X, and LinkedIn so Mat’s key public profiles are accessible immediately from the top-level nav. The change removes the Projects and Posts text nav items and replaces them with inline SVG icons while preserving existing nav link styling classes and adding explicit aria-label attributes for accessibility.

This shifts the header toward personal brand discovery and networking, but it also changes primary navigation behavior by reducing direct internal route entry points from the header, which may be worth validating against expected user flow.

I redesigned the homepage to support a scalable content model with multiple projects and live blog coverage, replacing the single-project structure with a dedicated hero, a selected-projects list, and a latest-posts feed sourced from the markdown blog loader. This gives Mat a landing page that can grow without layout rewrites and keeps writing visible on the front page as new posts are published.

I also reworked the home CSS system to establish a clearer visual hierarchy and responsive behavior across desktop and mobile, then adjusted the section treatment so project and post entries remain individual cards while the section containers themselves stay flat. The main follow-up is content quality and maintenance: featured projects are currently hardcoded in the route, so future updates still require code edits unless we move that data to a content source.

I reframed the second-brain post so it clearly answers when a frontend engineer should reach for TanStack Query over plain fetch, and I backed that argument with practical React examples and primary-source citations. I also renamed the document to "When to Reach for TanStack Query over Fetch" and updated its slug so the positioning matches the message Mat wanted.

I overhauled the long-form typography system across the markdown/article styles to improve readability, reducing oversized body text, tightening heading hierarchy, and refining spacing for lists, code blocks, and blockquotes so technical content scans better. The main follow-up is that the slug change updates the URL and the typography updates affect all posts, so we should do a quick visual pass across blog and second-brain pages in desktop/mobile and dark mode.

I updated the Second Brain page to introduce Marvin as Mat's AI virtual assistant and added a dedicated "Skills & Responsibilities" section that brands Second Brain as an AI Skill. I implemented a focused skill card with clearer feature copy, linked the skill source on GitHub through an icon action, and adjusted the card UX and styling to improve hierarchy, readability, and accessibility while keeping the card itself static with no hover effect.

I made these changes to package Second Brain as a visible product capability of Marvin and align the page copy with the actual `sbrain.sh` workflow. The main risk is copy drift if the script behavior changes again, so the feature bullets should stay synced to the skill spec and script flags to avoid mismatch.

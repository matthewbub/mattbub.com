Heroku and Vercel are cloud-based solutions that offer services to deploy, manage, and scale applications. If we were to look at both of these services from the perspective of their business models, they are similar in their services.

## So what's the difference?

Vercel caters to front-end projects, whereas Heroku is more generalized and supports a wider range of programming languages.

If you're looking to deploy an application built with a JavaScript framework such as Next.js, React, Angular, and Vue.js, Vercel is a favorable solution.

On the other hand, if your project isn't using a JavaScript Framework or requires a more versatile server-side configuration, Heroku might be a better fit. In addition to Node.js, Heroku supports languages like Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Go, and Scala.

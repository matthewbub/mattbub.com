		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find a tool I like working with. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I spend all day online, or it&rsquo;s more that I&rsquo;m a minimalist by nature. Interestingly enough, each of these services tends to specialize in one thing, and they serve that thing to their audience extremely well. Another interesting observation is that I&rsquo;ve unintentionally compiled a list of one-time-purchase products. I love that. ðŸ’š</p>

<h2 id="nota-https-nota-md"><a href="https://nota.md/" target="_blank">Nota</a></h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Nota for several years and continuously stand by it as my favorite notepad, if not my favorite application. I once migrated a 21-year-old Engineering Wiki from Confluence to SharePoint. Nota was the only middleman that could handle the document formatting. I love the flat-file system design; it works well with security concise documents where storing in a 3rd party cloud might not be permitted.</p>

<p>This app has a beautiful user interface; the creators boast their &ldquo;obsessive attention to detail,&rdquo; and I feel they have earned that title. I don&rsquo;t know why the product is still in beta, but if I had to guess, it would have something to do with the perfectionism of the authors. I recently found it lives within a <a href="https://twitter.com/antoniostoilkov/status/1665694345922506753" target="_blank">mono-repo with some other trendy products</a>, so I&rsquo;m confident this product lives strong.</p>

<p>I usually use the MacOS Calendar app. I&rsquo;ve tried some more premium services in the past. Still, it seems like most Calendar-based services are heavily focused on the email and meetings aspect of your day. I like to keep meetings to a minimum and am fine using Slack&rsquo;s alerts. Actually, I depend on those Slack alerts for meetings.</p>

<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m more interested in the time-tracking aspect of my day. Tim- Time Tracking stood out because the MacOS Calendar app has been my go-to for time tracking until now. Tim-Time Tracking feels like a more feature-rich version of the MacOS Calendar app.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/b6ScrfP.png" alt="Xnapper Screenshot" /></p>

<h2 id="xnapper-https-xnapper-com"><a href="https://xnapper.com/" target="_blank">Xnapper</a></h2>

<p>I assume &lsquo;Xnapper&rsquo; is pronounced like &lsquo;Snapper&rsquo; â€” does anyone know? This tool is slick for modifying screenshots, which I find myself doing more often than not with the default MacOS image editing software. Xnapper&rsquo;s real appeal (to me) is the consistent frame sizes I can produce. This is just my perfectionism speaking, but I enjoy consistency.</p>

<p>I like the UI&rsquo;s simplicity and the labels&rsquo; clarity. If you have a basic understanding of where you&rsquo;d prefer your files to save, too, it&rsquo;s easy enough to make the modifications needed. If you don&rsquo;t care like me, you can leave the default settings and snap away.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qKMecA9.png" alt="Screen Memory Screenshot" /></p>

<h2 id="screenmemory-https-screenmemory-app"><a href="https://screenmemory.app/" target="_blank">ScreenMemory</a></h2>

<p>ScreenMemory is a screen capture tool that captures your screen. This tool is one that I checked out and initially didn&rsquo;t purchase, <a href="https://www.inc.com/rebecca-deczynski/employee-monitoring-work-asynchronous-remote-hybrid-workplace.html" target="_blank">perhaps instinctively</a>. However, I feel this tool has done an excellent job providing all of the benefits of screen capture; without the invasive parts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also highly conscious of my digital privacy and like to avoid getting caught in the crossfire of data breaches far beyond my control. ScreenMemory uses my local machine&rsquo;s storage, and that makes me feel secure in that aspect. (That&rsquo;s the same reason I prefer <a href="#nota-https-nota-md">Nota</a> for my text editor.) Although local storage comes with the risk of potentially losing your content, I find it worth the peace of mind.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see what tools I&rsquo;ll be using around this same time next year; I&rsquo;ll set a reminder to do a follow-up article. Until then, what tools are you using? Do you prefer simplicity or functionality?

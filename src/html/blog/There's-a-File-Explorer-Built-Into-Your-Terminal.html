		<p>Did you know there&rsquo;s a file explorer built into your terminal? I&rsquo;m not talking about <code>ls</code> or even <code>ls -1</code> but rather the <a href="https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075" target="_blank">Netrw plugin</a> included in Vim!</p>

<p>To use Netrw, you&rsquo;ll need a basic understanding of <a href="https://www.matthewbub.com/articles/vim-motions-a-generalists-guide" target="_blank">how to navigate the Vim interface in Command mode</a>.</p>

<p>Once in Vim, we can enter the &ldquo;Explorer mode&rdquo; using the command <code>:Explore</code>. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the Explore mode is unique to Netrw.</p>

<h2 id="quick-keys">Quick Keys</h2>

<p>To open the file explorer in the current window, you can use the following to get where you&rsquo;re trying to go.</p>

<pre><code class="language-vim">:Explore
</code></pre>

<p>Or for a vertical split:</p>

<pre><code class="language-vim">:Vexplore
</code></pre>

<p>And for a horizontal split:</p>

<pre><code class="language-vim">:Sexplore
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty handy stuff. So, while drafting this article, I ended up diving much deeper into Netrw than I had initially anticipated. Here are some of the capabilities I&rsquo;ve discovered.</p>

<p>These are some cool things you can do once you&rsquo;ve entered the Explorer state.</p>

<h2 id="creating-files-and-directories">Creating Files and Directories</h2>

<p>You can create new files and directories directly from Netrw.</p>

<p><strong>To create a file</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the desired directory and press <code>%</code></li>
<li>Type the name of the new file.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="renaming-and-moving-files-or-directories">Renaming and Moving Files or Directories</h2>

<p><strong>To rename or move a file or directory</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>navigate to the item you want to rename, press <code>R</code>,</li>
<li>Type the new file name.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="deleting-files-and-directories">Deleting Files and Directories</h2>

<p><strong>To delete a file or directory</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the item and press <code>D</code></li>
<li>You will be asked to confirm the deletion.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>There are many reasons to like Vim; this is just one more. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot more to unpack here with Netrw, but it&rsquo;s interesting to know this type of capability is baked into our terminals and isn&rsquo;t unique to IDEs such as Neovim, as I might have assumed before.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Tailwind CSS Is Good for Us</h1>
    <p class="description">
      An exploration of Tailwind CSS, its benefits, and real-world application
      in Next.js development, discussing both its advantages and potential
      drawbacks.

      <p>
        I am not first person to go and jump on the bandwagon for the latest and
        greatest new framework or library. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was browsing
        the frontend subreddit when I stumbled across a seemingly one-sided
        argument stating that
        <strong
          >the philosophy of Tailwind is not a best practice due to the
          overwhelming nature of the html classes</strong
        >, comparing it to services such as Atomic CSS, (For those like myself
        that had to google that, Atomic CSS is a CSS architecture as a non
        opinionated set of classes representing single-purpose styling units).
      </p>

      <p>
        For one reason or another
        <strong>I decided to challenge this argument</strong> and would come to
        spend the next few weeks working with Tailwind as the library of choice
        for a real world Next.js Application.

        For the most part I have found the installation and setup to be a well
        documented and smooth process. There are a few caveats meaning that
        seemed a bit foreign coming from frameworks like Bootstrap, but none
        that were not quickly identified and adaptable early on. Very nice.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the credit of the developers, the website itself is quite solid in
        terms of accessibility and documentation. The theme is comparable to
        that of a simplified version of the
        <a href="https://stripe.com/docs" target="_blank"
          >Stripe Documentation</a
        >, bringing the &ldquo;everything you need&rdquo; and my personal
        favorite, &ldquo;no filler&rdquo; approach. I believe the documentation
        behind Tailwind is a big enough reason to assume Tailwind will stand the
        test of time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Getting back to my personal experience, once the development environment
        had been established and I was off to coding. I found the initial
        experience to be nothing like what the angry redditor had told us, at
        this point I am quickly becoming a fan. I even stumbled upon
        <a href="https://tailwinduikit.com/" target="_blank"
          >a spawn of Tailwind, (TUK)</a
        >
        that makes building templates feel more like Bootstrap. The React
        version needed a bit of rewiring for the <code>onClick</code> events,
        apparently the dev&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t notice? Anyways no big deal,
        nothing that wasn&rsquo;t worth doing in the grand scheme of things.

        I found that in a short amount of time I was styling components based
        off memory of the syntax alone. The class names being so similar to CSS
        really helps dull the learning curve. Although this would later prove a
        bit problematic when I migrated back to CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, you&rsquo;ve read that last bit right. When it comes down to it,
        the angry redditor was right. While Tailwind is incredibly fast for
        rapid prototyping, it truly does make for an overly long line of html.
        So what am I doing here hyping up Tailwind? The dev&rsquo;s over at
        Tailwind have created an incredibly thorough style guide for writing CSS
        with the easy to search details.
      </p>

      <p>
        While we are all in agreement that the data must live somewhere, I
        suppose I am suggesting to go with what works best for you. In my case I
        have found creating proprietary class names with smaller groups of
        styles to be more beneficial for my use case. I just feel
        <code>&quot;col&quot;</code> is a bit easier than
        <code>&quot;flex flex-col&quot;</code> but at this point I am just being
        nit picky. I think you see where I am going with this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I continue to work with various CSS preprocessor&rsquo;s and
        libraries. When it comes to starting new projects, I find myself
        consistently referring to Tailwind as a general style guide. Overall I
        would highly recommend you familiarize yourself with this modern
        framework that is paving the way for future front end development.

## Versioning

Currently, we're using the latest commit from `main` at the time of build. I currently don't have a need for the X.X.X format right now.

## Page Counter

Uses a session browser cookie with a TTL of 5 mins. **Y?** I opted for this route over tracking IPs because if you and your friend were both on the site and are in the same room theres a good chance you'll fall under the same IP and thus would only count as one page view.

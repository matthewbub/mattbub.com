@index.css @index.tsx I want this screen to use my style class names which require things to be extremely unique.

- Colors and fonts are variablized
- All CSS classes should be prefixed with zz-
- All classes use camel case after the intial prefix
- Classes should be generic. Atomic design
- Classes with zz-- are alignment values specific to the element and alignment on page
- Classes with zz- are defining characterisitcs
- I would rather classes be unique, so that if I ever need to change one elemnts value, i don't wreck the whole app. An execption to this is when mapping through content.
- I HATE cards, never use cards in design

Example
<a class="zz-button zz--contactFormButton">...

.zz-button {
/_ ..styles that make it look pretty by default _/
}

.zz-button:hover {
/_ hover state _/
}

.zz-contactFormButton {
align-self: end;
}
